# hello-world
My first repository. Although I have no idea what to do with it.
Recently I started to learn Python 3. I consider myself as an enthusiastic beginner.
My big goal is to build some Raspberry Pi robots with it's own AI. I know I'm far from that point, yet.
Yeah, machine learning sounds interesting, too.
